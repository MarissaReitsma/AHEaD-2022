```{r setup, include=FALSE}
## Set global options (apply to the whole file) and load packages here
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE) ## By default, will print out both code and results
library(tidyverse)
```

## R Markdown Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Simulation Exercise

Run the code below and respond to the questions. Remember you can use '?' in R to look up a help file for any function to learn more. For example, ?set.seed will give you the help file for generating random seeds.

```{r simulate_data}
# Set random seed so that data reproduces the same each time it is run
set.seed(27)

# Sample Size
n <- 1000

# Generate data
df <- data.frame(W1=runif(n, min=0.5, max=1),
		  W2=runif(n, min=0, max=1))
df <-  transform(df, #add Y
		  Y=rbinom(n, 1, 1 / (1 + exp(-(-3*W1 - 2*W2 + 2))) ) )
```

Summarize and visualize the data frame df.

```{r summarize}
## Summarize df


```

```{r visualize}
## Visualize df


```

Adapt the above code to add a variable W3 that is from a normal distribution to create a new data frame df2. W3, along with W1 and W2, should be used to generate Y in df2.

```{r add_W3}
## Create variable W3

## Create new data frame df2

## Create a new Y in df2 using W1, W2, and W3

```

Summarize and and visualize the data frame df2. Did you find anything unusual or troublesome about the Y variable in df2 versus df?

```{r summarize_df2}
## Summarize df2


```

```{r visualize_df2}
## Visualize df2


```
