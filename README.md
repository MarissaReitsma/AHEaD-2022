## Project description
What constitutes a fair or unfair algorithm is context specific. Metrics for evaluating fairness have been developed, as have methods for prioritizing measures of fairness when building algorithms. However, algorithms are not neutral and optimization choices will reflect a specific value system and the distribution of power to make these decisions. Data also reflect societal bias, such as structural racism. Algorithmic fairness research spans many fields, including sociology, ethics, computer science, statistics, and population health. These concepts are incredibly important given the potential for and actual realized harm to marginalized groups. This summer,  students will have the opportunity to learn more about ethical pipelines for algorithms and contribute to an ongoing project in health care insurance plan payment among older adults.  Changes in payment systems can lead to tremendous gains in access to care and improved health outcomes.  The specific goal of the overall project is to improve the undercompensation of minoritized racial and ethnic groups in the Medicare risk adjustment formula. 

Over the summer, AHEaD scholars will help make progress on improving equity for health care payments by working on some or all of the below: 

- Review and critique existing approaches to healthcare payment in a literature review
- Develop simulation data that reflects the population of older adults insured by Medicare
- Compare predictions of healthcare spending from ordinary least squares regressions and machine learning methods in simulated data
- Apply fair(er) algorithms to improve the undercompensation of minoritized racial and ethnic groups in simulated data

## Week 1 (June 21 - June 24)

#### *In-person programming at Stanford. Welcome!! :-)*

## Week 2 (June 27 - July 1)

#### Introduction to health insurance payment and algorithmic fairness in healthcare

This week we will focus on developing foundational knowledge for the project, including conducting a literature review. We don't expect you to understand everything, and we'll plan to discuss the readings each week as a group. Think about the main take-aways of each reading rather than feeling the need to keep track of specific details. 

**Readings** 

- [International Health Care System Profiles: United States](https://www.commonwealthfund.org/international-health-policy-center/countries/united-states)
- [Ethical machine learning in health care](https://github.com/MarissaReitsma/AHEaD-2022/raw/main/Readings/Chen%202021.pdf)

## Weeks 3-7 (July 5 - August 5)

#### Risk adjustment, simulation design, regression, and R

These weeks will focus on understanding existing approaches for risk adjustment, learning about and then designing simulated data, and implementing regression and machine learning approaches in R. We will add more specifics to this section each week as we build on the prior weeks progress.

## Week 8 (August 8 - August 16)

#### Wrap-up and present results

We'll use Week 8 to do final preparations to present on your summer research.
