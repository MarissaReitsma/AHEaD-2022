## Project description
What constitutes a fair or unfair algorithm is context specific. Metrics for evaluating fairness have been developed, as have methods for prioritizing measures of fairness when building algorithms. However, algorithms are not neutral and optimization choices will reflect a specific value system and the distribution of power to make these decisions. Data also reflect societal bias, such as structural racism. Algorithmic fairness research spans many fields, including sociology, ethics, computer science, statistics, and population health. These concepts are incredibly important given the potential for and actual realized harm to marginalized groups. This summer,  students will have the opportunity to learn more about ethical pipelines for algorithms and contribute to an ongoing project in health care insurance plan payment among older adults.  Changes in payment systems can lead to tremendous gains in access to care and improved health outcomes.  The specific goal of the overall project is to improve the undercompensation of minoritized racial and ethnic groups in the Medicare risk adjustment formula. 

Over the summer, AHEaD scholars can help make progress on improving equity for health care payments by working on one or more of the following: 

- Review and critique existing approaches to healthcare payment
- Develop simulation data that reflects the population of older adults insured by Medicare
- Compare predictions of healthcare spending from ordinary least squares regressions and machine learning methods
- Apply fair(er) algorithms to improve the undercompensation of minoritized racial and ethnic groups

## Week 1
####June 21 - June 24

####*In-person programming at Stanford*

## Week 2
####June 27 - July 1

#### Introduction to health insurance payment and algorithmic fairness in healthcare

This week we will focus on developing foundational knowledge for the project. We don't expect you to understand everything, and we'll plan to discuss the readings as a group on July 1.

## Week 3
####July 5 - July 8

#### Risk adjustment, regression, and R

Our specific project focuses on improving methods used for risk adjustment to improve undercompensation of minoritized racial and ethnic groups. This week we will focus on understanding existing approaches for risk adjustment. We'll also use time to prepare for starting the simulation study, including reviewing the curriculum on regression and R.

- Risk Adjustment for Health Plan Payment (sent by email)

## Weeks 4-7
####July 11 - August 5

#### Simulation study

We'll share more details as we get closer to starting the simulation study. Broadly, you will use the R programming language to: 

1. Simulate an individual-level dataset for the population insured by Medicare, including demographic data, health condition indicators, and spending.
2. Run OLS regression to predict healthcare spending.
3. Compare OLS results to other machine learning prediction methods.
4. Develop and apply fair(er) regression methods, and compare these to results from steps 2 & 3.

## Week 8
####August 8 - August 16

#### Wrap-up and present results

We'll use Week 8 to prepare to present on your summer research.
